`SK_java_patcher.bat` - A simple script created for manual Spiral Knights Java patching. Uses the same java_vm as Knight Launcher. Download and run, features SK path autodetection.

Dear Tech Supports, it's recommended to use this script if an user encounters a `java_vm` patching problem that is not solved by another KL patching. 
Alternatively, one can use it if, for some reason, KL java patcher fails.
